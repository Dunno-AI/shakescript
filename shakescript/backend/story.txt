  scene building like each scene/episode would have three things 
  1. goal of the scene
  2. conflict of the scene
  3. change / hooks ( how does story move forward)


  CHANGES NEEDED TO BE DONE IN MODEL :
  1. storage of emotions via chunks 
  2.



  for a single episode
      1. idea of the story
      2. characters of the story 
      3. phase (current)
      4. theme of the story
      5. previous episodes (
            1. content of prev 2 episodes
            2. key events till now 
            3. emotional chunks related to the episodes
            4. prev ep phases
            5. 
      )
