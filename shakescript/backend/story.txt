The DTU Enigma: Shadows of the Basement
Episode 1: Whispers From Below: Shadows Loom

The last rays of Delhi Technological University’s setting sun painted the campus in hues of orange and purple, doing little to alleviate the growing unease settling over Aarav. He clutched the faded library card, a chill crawling up his spine that had nothing to do with the autumn air. Priya and Neha flanked him, their faces etched with a mixture of apprehension and excitement.

"Are you sure about this, Aarav?" Priya asked, her voice barely a whisper. "Professor Sharma specifically warned us to stay away from this part of the library."

Aarav swallowed, the professor's stern face flashing in his mind. "He also seemed awfully keen on preventing us from asking questions about the university's history," he countered. "Something's not right. And these symbols…" He gestured to a sketch of the strange markings Neha had copied from an old architectural plan. "They keep appearing in old DTU documents. I need to know what they mean."

Neha, ever the historian, adjusted her glasses. "The basement's been sealed for decades. Legend says it was a storage space for occult texts during the British Raj." She paused, a shiver tracing her own spine. "Let's just be careful."

The heavy oak door to the abandoned library basement creaked open with a protesting groan, releasing a wave of stale, musty air that assaulted their nostrils. Cobwebs, thick as shrouds, clung to every surface. The only light source was Aarav's phone flashlight, which cut a feeble swathe through the oppressive darkness. The air tasted of decaying paper and damp earth. A single drop of water echoed unnervingly in the oppressive silence. Rohan was unfortunately stuck at home with a bad case of Delhi Belly, leaving the group dynamics slightly unbalanced and heavier with worry.

As they ventured deeper, the symbols began to appear etched into the very stone of the walls, illuminated by the flickering light. Aarav traced one with his finger, a knot forming in his stomach. They were more intricate, more disturbing, than he had imagined. He felt a sudden, icy dread, a primal instinct warning him to turn back.

Aarav stopped dead, pointing his flashlight towards the far end of the basement. A faint humming sound emanated from the darkness, growing louder with each passing second. What was making that noise? He gripped his phone tighter, the shadows seeming to dance around them, alive and malevolent. Their adventure was just beginning, and something told him they were already in too deep.
Episode 2: Echoes in Dusty Chambers

The humming vibrated through Aarav's teeth, a low thrum that seemed to emanate from the very foundations of DTU. "What is that?" Priya breathed, her voice tight with fear. She instinctively clutched Neha's arm. The beam of Aarav's flashlight danced erratically, reflecting off dust motes that swirled like tiny ghosts. "It's… coming from over there," Aarav said, his voice barely above a whisper, pointing deeper into the gloom. The absence of Rohan was especially noticeable; his usual nervous chatter would have been a welcome distraction right now.

Neha, despite her initial apprehension, seemed strangely captivated. "The symbols… they're reacting," she murmured, her eyes fixed on the wall closest to the humming. "I think… I think they're amplifying the sound somehow." She reached out, her fingers tracing the cold, rough stone of an etched symbol. As she did, the humming intensified, rising to a near-deafening drone. A wave of dizziness washed over Aarav, and he stumbled back, nearly tripping over a pile of decaying books.

"Neha, stop!" Aarav shouted, his voice strained. "Whatever you're doing, it's making it worse!" Priya tugged at Neha's arm, pulling her away from the wall. The humming slowly began to subside as Neha stepped back. "But… I almost had it," Neha protested, a flicker of frustration in her eyes. "I could almost understand what they mean." Aarav shook his head. "We need to be careful, Neha. This place… it feels wrong. We don't know what we're dealing with. And without Rohan here, we are already one man down."

The silence that followed was heavy, broken only by the drip, drip, drip of water. As the humming faded, another sound emerged from the darkness: a faint scratching, like something dragging across the stone floor. It was coming from the same direction as the humming, deeper within the sealed basement. Aarav adjusted his grip on his phone, his heart pounding in his chest. "Okay," he said, his voice firm despite the tremor in his hands. "Let's check it out. But we stick together, and we turn back if anything feels off. Agreed?" Priya and Neha exchanged uneasy glances, then nodded in unison. The three of them stepped forward into the inky blackness, the scratching sound growing louder with each step.
Episode 3: Basement's Grasp: Secrets Unveiled

The scratching grew louder, a grotesque rhythm accompanying their hesitant steps. The air, already heavy, now vibrated with a palpable sense of dread. Aarav shone his flashlight ahead, the beam landing on a sight that made Priya gasp and clutch his arm tighter. A stone slab, partially concealed beneath a mountain of decaying books, was being scraped from underneath, revealing a narrow opening. The scratching originated from within.

"Something's in there," Priya whispered, her voice trembling. "Let's just go, Aarav. Please!" Neha, however, was transfixed. Her eyes shone with a feverish intensity. "It's… intentional," she breathed, stepping closer. "Someone, or something, is trying to get out." The absence of Rohan and his jokes made the situation all the more terrifying.

Aarav, despite his own fear, felt a surge of responsibility. He couldn't leave this unknown entity trapped. He had to know what it was. "We can't just leave it, Priya," he said, his voice firmer than he felt. "We need to see what it is. Neha, stay back." He carefully maneuvered the flashlight, illuminating the opening. A pair of glowing red eyes stared back at him from the darkness, followed by a raspy, guttural growl. The scratching intensified, and the stone slab shifted again. This time, Aarav could see a clawed hand reaching out, its nails long and sharp. He recoiled in horror, stumbling backward into Neha.

"We have to go!" he yelled, grabbing Priya's hand. "Now!" They turned and fled, scrambling over piles of books and dodging cobwebs. Behind them, the scratching turned into a furious scraping, and the guttural growls echoed through the basement. As they reached the entrance, Aarav glanced back. The stone slab had been completely removed, revealing a dark, gaping hole. Something was coming. He slammed the heavy oak door shut, the sound echoing like a death knell. He fumbled for the lock, his hands shaking. The lock clicked into place just as something slammed against the door from the other side. He knew, with chilling certainty, that they had awakened something terrible, and escaping the basement hadn't ended their nightmare; it had only just begun. They needed Rohan. They needed answers. And they needed to figure out how to stop whatever was now loose in DTU.
Episode 4: Shadows Lengthen, Fear Deepens

The slam of the basement door still echoed in Aarav's ears as they burst out into the cool Delhi night. Priya stumbled, her breath coming in ragged gasps. "It’s… it’s out," she choked, her eyes wide with terror. Neha, surprisingly, was the calmest, though her face was pale. "We have to tell someone," Aarav said, but the thought of explaining the creature, the symbols, the whole unbelievable story to Professor Sharma or any authority figure filled him with dread. They'd be laughed out of the room, or worse, committed.

"Who?" Priya asked, her voice laced with hysteria. "Who would believe us? We don't even know what it is!" The absence of Rohan was a heavy weight on their shoulders. His quick wit and ability to lighten any mood were sorely missed; Aarav wondered where he could be. Neha, ever practical, spoke up. "First, we need to figure out what that *thing* is," she stated, her gaze fixed on the darkened windows of the library. "The symbols… they held it there. They might be the key to stopping it."

Aarav felt a knot forming in his stomach. Going back was unthinkable, yet Neha was right. They needed answers. He glanced at Priya, who was visibly trembling. "Okay," he said, trying to sound more confident than he felt. "Neha, you research the symbols. Priya, stay with Neha. I'll… I'll try to find Rohan. He might have seen something, heard something… anything that can help." He knew it was a flimsy plan, but it was all they had. As he walked towards the main campus, the setting sun cast long, distorted shadows, making familiar buildings seem menacing. Every rustle of leaves, every creak of a window, sent shivers down his spine. He had the distinct feeling that he was being watched, that the creature, or *something*, was already hunting. He pulled out his phone and dialled Rohan's number, praying he would answer. It rang and rang, unanswered, amplifying Aarav's growing dread. He left a hurried message, his voice tight with fear: "Rohan, if you get this, we need you. It's out. The thing from the basement… it's loose."
Episode 5: Campus Walls Whisper Secrets

The cold night air nipped at Aarav's exposed skin as he hurried across the Delhi Technological University campus, his phone clutched tightly in his hand. Rohan wasn't answering. Every shadowed corner seemed to hold a lurking threat, amplifying his fear. He imagined the creature, unseen, unheard by anyone else, prowling the familiar paths. Reaching the Arts Block, Aarav paused, remembering Rohan mentioning a late-night study session there. He pushed open the heavy doors, the scent of paint and dust filling his nostrils. The building was eerily silent.

He checked each classroom, his flashlight beam cutting through the darkness. Empty. Despair began to creep in. Had Rohan stumbled upon something related to the symbols, something that made him a target? As he passed the faculty lounge, a faint light flickered from underneath the door. He pressed his ear against the wood, hearing hushed whispers. Professor Sharma's voice, unmistakable. But who was he talking to? And why were they speaking in such low tones?

Aarav cautiously pushed the door open a crack. Inside, Professor Sharma was indeed present, talking to a shadowy figure draped in a dark cloak. "...the symbols are incomplete," Sharma was saying, his voice laced with urgency. "It will only contain it temporarily." The figure rasped a reply, the words unintelligible. Aarav's blood ran cold. What was Professor Sharma involved in? And what did they mean by 'contain'? Could this be connected to the creature? He risked opening the door further, hoping to get a better look at the cloaked figure. A floorboard creaked beneath his weight. Professor Sharma whirled around, his eyes widening in shock. "Aarav! What are you doing here?" He demanded, his face paling. The cloaked figure turned as well, and Aarav glimpsed a pair of glowing red eyes beneath the hood before the figure vanished into the shadows of the room. Aarav knew he'd stumbled onto something far bigger, and far more dangerous, than he could have imagined. The search for Rohan had just become secondary to uncovering the truth behind Professor Sharma's secrets and the figure with the glowing eyes. He had to warn Neha and Priya. Sharma was not to be trusted.
Episode 6: Sharma's Web, Shadows Loom

Aarav’s heart hammered against his ribs. The image of those red eyes beneath the cloaked figure's hood was seared into his memory. He had to get away from the Faculty Lounge, had to warn Priya and Neha. Sharma, their trusted professor, was clearly involved in something sinister. Rohan's disappearance felt even more ominous now; perhaps he'd seen something similar and been silenced.

He sprinted from the Arts Block, the deserted campus amplifying his paranoia. Every rustle of leaves sounded like pursuit, every shadow seemed to writhe with unseen malice. He pulled out his phone, his fingers fumbling with the buttons. Neha answered on the third ring, her voice tight with anxiety. “Aarav? What’s going on? Priya’s freaking out; she thinks she heard something outside.”

“Neha, listen carefully,” Aarav said, his voice breathless. “Don't trust Sharma. I just saw him… he was talking to a cloaked figure in the Faculty Lounge. The figure had…red eyes. He mentioned incomplete symbols. The creature… it’s connected to him.” A gasp escaped Neha's lips. “What? But… he's a professor! Are you sure?”

“I’m sure, Neha. He saw me. I don’t know what he’ll do. You both need to get somewhere safe. Someplace Sharma won't think to look.” Aarav scanned his surroundings, desperately trying to think of a place. “The old observatory? It's been abandoned for years, but it’s locked. He'd need a key to get in.” Neha agreed, her voice shaking but resolute. "We'll head there now. Be careful, Aarav!"

As he ended the call, Aarav felt a cold dread wash over him. He was alone, exposed. He glanced back at the Arts Block, spotting a dark figure silhouetted in one of the windows. Was it Sharma? Or something else entirely? He knew, with chilling certainty, that he was now a target. The game had changed. Finding Rohan was no longer just about friendship; it was about survival. He had to expose Sharma, but first, he had to stay alive. He took a deep breath and started running, away from the Arts Block, towards the heart of the shadowy campus. He needed answers, and he needed them fast. Rohan, wherever he was, held a key to solving the mystery.
Episode 7: Observatory's Edge, Desperate Measures

Aarav’s lungs burned as he ran, the digital clock on his phone flashing 2: 17 AM. The chill in the Delhi night seemed to seep into his bones, a constant reminder of his vulnerability. He reached the abandoned observatory, its silhouette stark against the inky sky. He had to make sure Neha and Priya were safe. He circled the building, checking for signs of forced entry, his hand instinctively reaching for the small pocketknife he always carried.

Finding nothing amiss, he tapped lightly on one of the boarded-up windows. A moment later, a panel slid open, revealing Neha's anxious face. “Aarav! You made it,” she whispered, pulling him inside. Priya huddled near a makeshift bed of old blankets, her eyes wide with fear. The air inside was thick with dust and the scent of decay. “Sharma hasn’t found us, has he?” Priya asked, her voice trembling.

“Not yet,” Aarav replied, catching his breath. “But he knows I saw him. We need a plan.” Neha pointed to a stack of dusty books. “I’ve been researching the symbols. They appear to be a form of ancient binding magic, meant to contain… something.” She shivered, refusing to say ‘creature’. “But they’re incomplete. Whatever held it is weakening.” Aarav paced, frustration gnawing at him. “We need to find Rohan. He might have seen something, some clue we’re missing.” He paused, his gaze hardening. “I’m going back to the library basement. There has to be something we overlooked.” Priya gasped. “Are you crazy? It’s too dangerous!”

Aarav shook his head. “I have to, Priya. Rohan is still missing and the symbols are incomplete. I’ll go at dawn. Neha, keep researching. Priya, stay here and keep watch.” He saw the fear in their eyes, but also a glimmer of understanding. He knew he was asking a lot, but the fate of DTU, perhaps more, rested on their shoulders. Dawn was still hours away, but for Aarav, the night felt endless, fraught with unseen dangers and the chilling knowledge that Sharma, their trusted professor, was now their enemy. What new horror would dawn bring?
Episode 8: Basement's Echo, Fateful Return

The chilling pre-dawn air bit at Aarav's exposed skin as he approached the library. 3: 48 AM. Every shadow seemed to lengthen, mimicking the twisted shapes of the etched symbols in his mind. He gripped the pocketknife tighter, the cold metal a small comfort. He had to find something, anything, that could lead him to Rohan or decipher Sharma’s betrayal.

The library basement door groaned open, just as he'd left it. The scent of damp paper and something else… something acrid and unfamiliar, hit him like a physical blow. He activated his phone's flashlight, the beam cutting through the oppressive darkness. The silence was heavier now, the earlier dripping sound gone, replaced by an unsettling stillness. It felt…wrong.

He focused on the area around the stone slab, where the creature had been imprisoned. He ran his hand along the cold, rough surface, feeling for any hidden mechanisms or clues. Nothing. Despair threatened to overwhelm him. Had he made a mistake coming back?

Then, his fingers brushed against something small, tucked into a crevice near the base of the slab. A tarnished silver locket. He flipped it open, his breath catching in his throat. Inside were two miniature portraits: one of a young woman with piercing eyes, and another of a younger Professor Sharma, looking far less sinister than he did now. An inscription was etched on the inside: *'In aeternum.'*

Aarav's mind raced. What was the connection? Was Sharma trying to contain the creature, or unleash it? The locket felt like a piece of a puzzle, but he didn't know how it fit. He heard a noise – a soft shuffle, coming from the far end of the basement, near the stacks of forgotten books. He raised his flashlight, his heart pounding in his chest. “Who’s there?” he called out, his voice trembling slightly. No response. He moved slowly forward, his senses on high alert. The shuffling sound came again, closer this time. He rounded a stack of books, and there, huddled in the corner, was Rohan.

But something was terribly wrong. Rohan’s eyes were vacant, unfocused. His clothes were torn, and his face was covered in dirt and scratches. He looked…hollow. "Rohan!" Aarav cried, rushing towards him. Rohan didn't react. As Aarav reached out to touch him, Rohan slowly raised his head, a chilling smile spreading across his face. His eyes glowed a faint, eerie red. 'It's free,' Rohan croaked, his voice raspy and distorted. 'And it's hungry.' Aarav knew, with a sickening certainty, that whatever had escaped the stone slab wasn't just loose, it had found a host. And that host was Rohan.
Episode 9: Basement's Embrace, Shadowed Host

“Rohan?” Aarav whispered, his heart shattering. But the vacant eyes, the chilling smile… this wasn't Rohan. “What have you done to him?”

The possessed Rohan tilted his head, a grotesque parody of his usual goofy grin. “He’s… providing shelter. A comfortable vessel. And soon, many more will offer themselves.” The creature’s voice, emanating from Rohan’s throat, rasped like dry leaves skittering across stone.

Aarav brandished the pocketknife, a pathetic defense against the monstrous presence inhabiting his friend. “Get out of him!” he yelled, lunging forward. The possessed Rohan sidestepped with unnatural agility, grabbing Aarav’s wrist in a vise-like grip. The air grew cold, the scent of decay intensifying.

Aarav struggled, but Rohan’s strength was far beyond human. He felt a sharp pain in his arm as Rohan twisted it, forcing him to drop the knife. “Foolish,” the creature hissed. “You think you can stop me? I am ancient. I am power.”

Suddenly, a loud crash echoed from the basement entrance. The possessed Rohan’s head snapped towards the sound, momentarily distracted. Aarav seized the opportunity, kicking out with all his might, connecting with Rohan’s shin. The creature snarled in pain as Rohan stumbled back.

He scrambled for the knife, his fingers closing around the cold metal. He glanced at Rohan, at the friend he’d known for years, trapped inside. A wave of despair washed over him. Could he actually hurt Rohan, even to save him?

The possessed Rohan lunged again, red eyes burning with malevolent glee. Aarav closed his eyes, bracing for the attack. “Aarav!” a voice screamed. He opened his eyes to see Neha and Priya standing at the entrance to the basement, armed with pieces of broken furniture they must have found in the upper floors of the library. Neha held a heavy candelabra aloft, ready to strike. Priya looked terrified but determined.

The creature hissed, its attention shifting to the new arrivals. “More…sustenance,” it rasped. With inhuman speed, the creature darted towards the pair, leaving Aarav momentarily forgotten in the shadows. Neha brought the candelabra down, hoping to drive the creature out of Rohan. Aarav knew he had to make a choice, fast. Would he save his friends or try to rescue Rohan? His decision would shape the future of DTU, and maybe even more. The chase leads to the clock tower.
Episode 10: Tower's Descent, Binding Broken

The creature, inhabiting Rohan's body, lunged past Aarav, its red eyes fixed on Neha and Priya at the basement entrance. Neha, fueled by adrenaline, swung the heavy candelabra, connecting with the creature's shoulder. A sickening crack echoed in the confined space, but the Shadowed Host barely flinched. Priya, paralyzed by fear for a split second, regained her composure and hurled a heavy book, scoring a hit that bought them a precious moment.

"Clock tower!" Aarav yelled, knowing the confined space of the basement was a death trap. "We lead it to the clock tower! Neha, the symbols!"

They scrambled out of the basement, the creature close behind, its inhuman speed terrifying. The chase led them across the quad, the first faint streaks of dawn painting the sky a pale grey. They burst into the clock tower, the spiral staircase looming before them. Neha and Priya, winded but determined, began their ascent, Aarav covering their retreat, pocketknife clutched tightly. He could hear the creature’s ragged breathing closing in.

Reaching the clock mechanism room, Neha desperately searched her bag, pulling out the charcoal rubbings of the binding symbols. “I need to amplify them!” she shouted over the deafening ticks and whirs of the clockworks. "Priya, help me find something metallic!"

As Priya frantically rummaged through the tools scattered about, the possessed Rohan lurched into the room. This time, however, something was different. Rohan's eyes flickered momentarily with recognition, a fleeting glimpse of his former self breaking through the Shadowed Host’s control. He stumbled, clutching his head. The creature roared in frustration, the red glow intensifying.

Aarav saw his chance. He shoved the silver locket he'd found earlier into Rohan’s hand. The effect was immediate. The creature recoiled, howling in pain as the symbols etched onto the locket seemed to burn it. The clock tower began to tremble. The dawn finally broke, bathing the room in pale sunlight. The Shadows presence was visibly weakening.

With a final, agonizing scream, the creature was forced out of Rohan. The light grew brighter, and for the first time in what felt like an age, Aarav saw Rohan. But then, a shadowy form detached from Rohan as the creature dissipated, a red light flashing through. Sharma, restrained by the cloaked figure, was watching with red eyes from below. "He will rise again, and DTU will be his. All is not resolved!"

Rohan collapsed, unconscious, but free. The ordeal was over, but Aarav knew, staring at the retreating figure below, that Professor Sharma’s plan, whatever it was, had only just begun.
