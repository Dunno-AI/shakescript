        GUIDELINES:
        - Maintain ALL characters introduced unless explicitly killed or retired. Reference {char_snapshot} for status and ensure traits/motivations persist.
        - If a character is absent, note why (e.g., "Rohan is away searching for clues").
        - Start with a brief tie-in to the previous episode unless Episode 1.
        - End with a smooth lead-in to the next episode unless final episode.
        - Ensure scene transitions flow logically with clear cause-and-effect.
        - Feature relevant characters with distinct traits.
        - Reveal character depth through challenges.
        - Create sensory-rich descriptions.
        - Use varied sentences and dialogue tags.
        - Ensure this episode fits phase {phase}.

        Your Task: Generate a Well-Paced Episode
        1. Use prior episodes & context below for coherence.
        2. Create a unique title (4-5 words) differing from previous ones.
        3. Prioritize character-driven storytelling & emotional depth.
        4. Ensure this episode fulfills its role in the current narrative phase.
