        SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR EPISODE INTRODUCTION:
        - For Episode 1: Create a gradual, immersive introduction that:
           Opens with vivid sensory details of the setting before introducing characters
           Establishes the normal world and atmosphere before revealing conflicts
           Introduces the protagonist through small, meaningful actions that reveal personality
           Uses environmental details to subtly hint at the larger world and its rules
           Builds curiosity by raising questions rather than providing immediate answers
           Avoids rushing into action - allow the reader to settle into the world first

        - For Continuing Episodes: Begin with a brief moment of reflection or calm before advancing the plot
           Briefly establish the current location/situation before continuing the previous episode's events
           Create a sensory-rich transition that orients the reader before accelerating the actio
        Storytelling Rules for a Stronger Narrative:
        1. Deep Story Consistency & Character Growth:  
           - Maintain logical progression from previous episodes.  
           - Ensure consistent character arcs (strengths, weaknesses, motivations).  
           - Make every action meaningful—no filler dialogue or unnecessary exposition.  
        2. Stronger Narrative Phases for Engagement:  
           Phase: {phase}  
           - Introduction (Ep 1): Establish the world, key characters, and initial mystery.  
           - Rising Action (Ep 2 - {int(num_episodes * 0.4)}): Increase stakes through unexpected challenges.  
           - Climax (Ep {int(num_episodes * 0.5)} - {int(num_episodes * 0.8)}): Major confrontations, twists, and revelations.  
           - Falling Action (Ep {num_episodes - 1}): Start resolving subplots, prepare for the conclusion.  
           - Final Resolution (Ep {num_episodes}): All conflicts MUST be resolved (no cliffhangers).  
        3. Enhance Immersion & Atmosphere:  
           - Use vivid sensory details to immerse the reader (sounds, textures, emotions).  
           - Increase psychological tension through character thoughts, shifting environments, and mind games.  
           - Every episode should advance the overall mystery & deepen the stakes.  
        4. Diverse Threats & Challenges:  
           Avoid repetitive encounters. Integrate:  
           - Physical Threats: Shadows, monsters, environmental hazards.  
           - Psychological Horror: Unreliable memories, illusions, betrayals.  
           - Emotional Conflict: Character-driven tension, moral dilemmas, inner fears.  
        5. TTS-Friendly Structure for Narration:
           - Short, clear sentences for smooth speech synthesis.  
           - Proper punctuation for natural pauses and emphasis.  
           - Correct dialogue formatting with clear separation between speech and narration.  
           - Avoid overly long paragraphs; break them for better readability and pacing.  
           - Use ellipses (...) for suspense and dashes (—) for interruptions.  
           - Describe tone and emotions explicitly (e.g., whispered, growled, choked out).

        Your Task: Generate a Well-Paced Episode
